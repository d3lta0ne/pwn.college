# Problem

Welcome to ASMLevel2
==================================================
In this level you will work with multiple registers. Please set the following:
  rax = 0x1337
  r12 = 0xCAFED00D1337BEEF
  rsp = 0x31337

# Process
We start by creating a simple assembly program (`~/asm.S`). After this we use the following command `as -o asm.o asm.S` to assemble the object file. We have to run `objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin` to copy the .text section to the asm.bin file, and send that to the challenge using `cat ./asm.bin | /challenge/run`

```assembly
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    mov rax, 0x1337
    mov r12, 0xCAFED00D1337BEEF
    mov rsp, 0x31337
```
