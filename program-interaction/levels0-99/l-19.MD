# Process
Before invoking the ipython we must create the specifed file that is requested in the project. We do this by using the following command: `echo "yltuzpik" > /tmp/gzxehm`. This can also optionally be done within ipython but I prefer doing it earlier since I always run the challenge first to see if it is still even an ipython challenge. We then invoke `ipython` in the shell.

## Program
```python
import subprocess

# Path to the challenge
executable_path = '/challenge/embryoio_level19'

# Arguments to pass to the executable
args = []

# Environmental Variables to pass to subprocess
sub_env = {}

# Run the executable with the specific file as input
with open('/tmp/gzxehm', 'w+') as input_file:
    # Write the hardcoded password to the file
    # Use this line only if you did not create the file with text using bash.
    file.write('yltuzpik\n')

    # Move the file pointer to the beginning of the file
    file.seek(0)

    result = subprocess.run([executable_path] + args, capture_output=True, text=True, env=sub_env, stdin=input_file)

# Print the output and error messages
print("Output:", result.stdout)
# print("Error:", result.stderr)
# print("Return Code:", result.returncode)
```
## Notes
The `input` parameter in the subprocess run command requires a mapping of environmental variables so I decided to submit them using a seperate variable than in line for ease of use.
