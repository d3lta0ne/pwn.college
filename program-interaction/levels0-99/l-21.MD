4# Process
For the sake of simplicity and speed, we create a python script in a preferred editor and just invoke it using ipython to meet the challenge objectives. Ensure that the file is added in our home directory and made executable (`touch script.py; chmod +x script.py`). We then invoke `ipython` in the shell and use the ipython magic command run `%run .~/script` to get the solution.

## Program
```python
import subprocess

# Path to the challenge
executable_path = '/challenge/embryoio_level20'
sub_env = {}
result = subprocess.run([executable_path], env=sub_env, capture_output=True)

print(result.stout)
```
## Notes
We open the file with 'w+' because we are going to write and read to the file output.
