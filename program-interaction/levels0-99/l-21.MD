# Process
The challenge checks to see if the environment is empty. I do this by intializing a `sub_env` variable to an empty dictionary. We then create a script that is in our home directory and executable (`touch script.py; chmod +x script.py`). AFteer we invoke `ipython` in the shell and use the ipython magic command run `%run ~/script` to get the solution.

## Program
```python
import subprocess

# Path to the challenge
executable_path = '/challenge/embryoio_level21'
sub_env = {}
result = subprocess.run([executable_path], env=sub_env, capture_output=True, text=True)

print(result.stdout)
```
