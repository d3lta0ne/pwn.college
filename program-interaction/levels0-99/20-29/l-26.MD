# Process
WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
- the challenge checks for a specific parent process : python
- the challenge will check that input is redirected from a specific file path : /tmp/lcghdf
- the challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : hpvlhbyn
 
I create a very simple python script that just runs the challenge script and imports the subprocess module to meet the other tasks. I create this script in my home directory and it executable (`touch script.py; chmod +x script.py`). After this I pass my script to the python interpreter using `python script.py` to get the solution.

## Program
```python
import subprocess
executable_path = '/challenge/embryoio_level26'
with open('/tmp/lcghdf', 'w+') as input_file:
    input_file.write('hpvlhbyn\n')
    input_file.seek(0)
    result = subprocess.run([executable_path], capture_output=True, text=True, stdin=input_file)
print(result.stdout)
```
