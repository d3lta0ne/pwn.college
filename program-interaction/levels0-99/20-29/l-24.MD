# Process
This challenge checks to see if the first argument passed in is 'ffglncvhan'. I create a very simple python script that just runs the challenge script. I create this script in my home directory and it executable (`touch script.py; chmod +x script.py`). After this I pass my script to the python interpreter using `python script.py` to get the solution.

## Program
```python
import subprocess
executable_path = '/challenge/embryoio_level24'
result = subprocess.run([executable_path, 'ffglncvhan'], capture_output=True, text=True)
print(result.stdout)
```
