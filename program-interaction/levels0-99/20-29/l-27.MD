# Process
WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
- the challenge checks for a specific parent process : python
- the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : /tmp/bktoji

I create a very simple python script that just runs the challenge script and imports the subprocess module to meet the other tasks. I create this script in my home directory and it executable (`touch script.py; chmod +x script.py`). After this I pass my script to the python interpreter using `python script.py` to get the solution.

## *script.py*
```python
import subprocess
executable_path = '/challenge/embryoio_level27'
with open('/tmp/bktoji', 'w+') as output_file:
    result = subprocess.run([executable_path], stdout=output_file, text=True)
    output_file.seek(0)
    print(output_file.read())
```
