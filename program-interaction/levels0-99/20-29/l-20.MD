# Process
For the sake of simplicity and speed, we create a python script in a preferred editor and just invoke it using ipython to meet the challenge objectives. Ensure that the file is added in our home directory and made executable (`touch script.py; chmod +x script.py`). We then invoke `ipython` in the shell and use the ipython magic command run `%run .~/script` to get the solution.

## Program
```python
import subprocess

# Path to the challenge
executable_path = '/challenge/embryoio_level20'

with open("/tmp/rfqbmu", "w+") as output_file:
    result = subprocess.run([executable_path], stdout=output_file)
    # Move the file pointer to the start of the file, this is important since we just wrote to it.
    output_file.seek(0)
    # Print redirected file output
    print(output_file.read())
```
## Notes
We open the file with 'w+' because we are going to write and read to the file output.
