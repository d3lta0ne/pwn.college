# Problem


# Process
We write and then compile our script program using the following command `gcc ~/scipt.c -o ~/script`. To solve this problem we can either hard-code the password through the shell by piping it to our binary `echo 'yjgngclz' | .~/script` or we can code it in our binary and just run `.~/script`.
