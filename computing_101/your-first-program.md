## Problem

In this challenge, you will write your first assembly. You must move the value `60` into `rax`. Write your program in a file with a .s extension, such as rax-challenge.s (while not mandatory, .s is the typical extension for assembly files), and pass it as an argument to the /challenge/check file (e.g., `/challenge/check rax-challenge.s`).

# Process

Create a file using `touch rax-challenge.s` and then type `move rax, 60` into that file. Then pass it as an argument to the /challenge/check program using `/challenge/check rax-challenge.s`.
