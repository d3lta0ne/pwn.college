# Problem
Welcome to ASMLevel1
==================================================
In this level you will work with registers! Please set the following:
  rdi = 0x1337

Please give me your assembly in bytes (up to 0x1000 bytes):

# Process
We start by creating a simple assembly program (`~/asm.S`) that sets the `%rdi` register to `0x1337`. After this we use the following command `as -o asm.o asm.S` to assemble the object file

```assembly
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    mov rdi, 0x1337
```
