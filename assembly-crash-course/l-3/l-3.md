# Problem

Welcome to ASMLevel3
==================================================

Here are some useful instructions:
  add reg1, reg2       <=>     reg1 += reg2
  sub reg1, reg2       <=>     reg1 -= reg2
  imul reg1, reg2      <=>     reg1 *= reg2

div is more complicated and we will discuss it later.
Note: all 'regX' can be replaced by a constant or memory location

Do the following:
  add 0x331337 to rdi

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
  rdi = 0xb09

# Process
We start by creating a simple assembly program (`~/asm.S`). After this we use the following command `as -o asm.o asm.S` to assemble the object file. We have to run `objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin` to copy the .text section to the asm.bin file, and send that to the challenge using `cat ./asm.bin | /challenge/run`

```assembly
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    add rdi, 0x331337

```
