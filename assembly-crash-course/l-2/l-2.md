# Problem

Welcome to ASMLevel2
==================================================
In this level you will work with multiple registers. Please set the following:
  rax = 0x1337
  r12 = 0xCAFED00D1337BEEF
  rsp = 0x31337

# Process
We start by creating a simple assembly program (`~/asm.S`). After this we use the following command `as -o asm.o asm.S` to assemble the object file.

```assembly
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

_start:

```
