# Problem

Welcome to ASMLevel4
==================================================

Using your new knowledge, please compute the following:
  f(x) = mx + b, where:
    m = rdi
    x = rsi
    b = rdx

In this case, you will want to use imul.

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
  rdi = 0x1c5a
  rsi = 0x1d3c
  rdx = 0x1b58

Please give me your assembly in bytes (up to 0x1000 bytes): 

# Process
We start by creating a simple assembly program (`~/asm.S`). After this we use the following command `as -o asm.o asm.S` to assemble the object file. We have to run `objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin` to copy the .text section to the asm.bin file, and send that to the challenge using `cat ./asm.bin | /challenge/run`

```assembly
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

_start:
    add rdi, 0x331337

```
