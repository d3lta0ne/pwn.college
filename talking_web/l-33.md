# Problem

Make an HTTP request to 127.0.0.1 on port 80 to get the flag. Make any HTTP request, and the server will send you an HTTP response that redirects you to the flag.
You must make this request using python

# Process

## Option 1 -- Requests Library

```python
import requests
requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:80")
```

### Notes

If you send a GET request to the web root (`/`), you will see in on the Server output that a request to `/1381e730b560cb2e4d97a515f7ac56a7` is made. This is the location of where to redirect to access the flag. You can then resend a request to the proper location and also access the flag there.

## Option 2 -- Builtin Libraries

```python
import urllib.request
request = urllib.request.Request("http://127.0.0.1:80", method='GET')
with urllib.request.urlopen(request) as response:
    # Read and decode the response
    print(response.read().decode('utf-8'))

```
