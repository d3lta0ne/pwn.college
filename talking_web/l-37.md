## Problem

Make an HTTP request to `127.0.0.1` on port `80` to get the flag. The server requires that you make 4 stateful requests. You must make this request using the curl command

## Steps

Make an initial connection to the local host using using redirects and saving cookies to get the flag.

### Notes

After you save cookies to a file with `-c cookies.txt`, `curl` will automatically load the cookies from that file for subsequent requests without needing the `-b` option. This is because `curl` automatically checks for a cookie jar (cookie file) when itâ€™s made a request and will use that jar on any subsequent requests.

### solution.sh

```bash
curl -Lvk -c cookies.txt
```

### solution_1.sh

```bash
curl_request(){
  local HOST=$1
  local PORT=$2
  local COOKIE_FILE="cookies.txt"

  # Use -b if the cookie file exists, else use -c to create the cookie file
  curl -Lkv $( [ -s $COOKIE_FILE ] && echo "-b $COOKIE_FILE" || echo "-c $COOKIE_FILE" ) "http://$HOST:$PORT"
}

main
```
