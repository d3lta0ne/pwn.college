# Problem

Make an HTTP request to 127.0.0.1 on port 80 to get the flag. Make any HTTP request, and the server will ask you to set a cookie. Make another request with that cookie to get the flag.
You must make this request using the curl command

# Process

```bash
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:80/ -c cookies.txt; curl -b cookies.txt -v http://127.0.0.1:80/
```

## Notes

When we attempted to just run `curl -Lv http://127.0.0.1:80/` we got a `curl: (47) Maximum (50) redirects followed` error as the default redirects is set to 50 for curl and we did not set a cookie in our request.
