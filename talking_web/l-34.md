# Problem

Make an HTTP request to 127.0.0.1 on port 80 to get the flag. Make any HTTP request, and the server will ask you to set a cookie. Make another request with that cookie to get the flag.
You must make this request using the curl command

# Process

We send the first HTTP GET Request and use the `-c` curl flag to save the cookies to a `~/cookies`. We then resend the request with the cookies using the `-b` flag.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:80/ -c ~/cookies; curl -b ~/cookies -Lv http://127.0.0.1:80/
```

## Notes

When we attempted to just run `curl -Lv http://127.0.0.1:80/` we got a `curl: (47) Maximum (50) redirects followed` error as the default redirects is set to 50 for curl and we did not set a cookie in our request.
