# Problem

Make an HTTP request to 127.0.0.1 on port 80 to get the flag. Make any HTTP request, and the server will send you an HTTP response that redirects you to the flag.
You must make this request using the nc command

# Process

We create a `~/script.sh` file that contains the following code. After making the script executable with `chmod +x ~/script.sh` we can run it with `.~/script.sh` Initially, we sent a GET request to the web root (`/`). After running the script we recieved a response that we should be redirected to `/24d9ef1ea5a0640ddec4f205b337800f`. Since nc has no way of automatically following redirects, we resend the GET request with the proper location identifier (i.e. `$QUERY` changed from `/` to `/24d9ef1ea5a0640ddec4f205b337800f`).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# HTTP GET w/ netcat
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=80
QUERY='/24d9ef1ea5a0640ddec4f205b337800f'
echo -e "GET $QUERY HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: $HOST\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" | nc $HOST $PORT
```
