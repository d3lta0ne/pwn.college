## Problem

Make an HTTP request to `127.0.0.1` on port `80` to get the flag. Make any HTTP request, and the server will ask you to set a cookie. Make another request with that cookie to get the flag. You must make this request using the `nc` command.

## Steps

We send the first HTTP Request and are told by the server by the `Set-Cookie` Header in the response to save the cookie `cookie=09bc921386a69fc1b2930e233d0a5aa3`. We resend a request using `nc` with that cookie set.

### solution.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# HTTP POST w/ netcat
HOST="127.0.0.1"
PORT=80
PATH='/'
DATA='{"key":"value"}'  # Example POST data (JSON format)
CONTENT_LENGTH=${#DATA}
COOKIE='cookie=09bc921386a69fc1b2930e233d0a5aa3'

# Function to send a request and print response
send_request() {
  local url=$1
  local data=$2
  local cookie=$3

  REQUEST=$(printf "POST %s HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: %s\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nContent-Length: %d\r\nCookie: %s\r\n\r\n%s" \
    "$url" "$HOST" "$CONTENT_LENGTH" "$cookie" "$data")

  echo -e "$REQUEST" | /usr/bin/nc.openbsd "$HOST" "$PORT"
}

# First request to send the POST data
response=$(send_request "$PATH" "$DATA" "$COOKIE")
```
