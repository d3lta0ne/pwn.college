# Problem

Make an HTTP request to 127.0.0.1 on port 80 to get the flag.
The HTTP request must specify a content type HTTP header of 'application/json'
Must send an HTTP POST with the body as a JSON object that has:
a pair with name of `a` and a value of 38252d237978573f74f42f11c8618cb5
a pair with name of `b` and a value of a object that has:
a pair with name of `c` and a value of 616128f8
a pair with name of `d` and a value that is a list with the following elements:
4a88210a
2be126eb 6dfe47bf&e2468b15#68457cb4
You must make this request using the nc command

# Process
We create a `~/script.sh` file that contains the following code. After making the script executable with `chmod +x ~/script.sh` we can run it with `.~/script.sh`.

## Code

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# HTTP POST w/ netcat
HOST=$TARGET_IP
PORT=$TARGET_PORT
PATH='/'
DATA='{"a":"38252d237978573f74f42f11c8618cb5","b":{"c":"616128f8","d":["4a88210a","2be126eb 6dfe47bf&e2468b15#68457cb4"]}}'
CONTENT_LENGTH=${#DATA}

# Use a here-document to send the POST request with nc
REQUEST=$(printf "POST %s HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: %s\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nContent-Length: %d\r\n\r\n%s" \
  "$PATH" "$HOST" "$CONTENT_LENGTH" "$DATA")

echo -e "$REQUEST" | nc "$HOST" "$PORT"
```
