# Problem
After running the challenge program (`/challenge/run`), we are presented with the following task objectives.

Make an HTTP request to 127.0.0.1 on port 80 to get the flag.
The HTTP request must specify HTTP POST parameter `a` as value `583380eef26d372f7e6bf15a7f1ef725`
You must make this request using the nc command

# Process
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Send an HTTP POST Request using nc
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=80
PATH='/'
DATA='a=583380eef26d372f7e6bf15a7f1ef725'
CONTENT_LENGTH=${#DATA}

# Use a here-document to send the POST request with nc
/run/challenge/bin/nc $HOST $PORT <<EOF
POST $PATH HTTP/1.0
Host: $HOST
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: $CONTENT_LENGTH

$DATA
EOF
```

## Notes
It is important to not that the version of `nc` which is needed to be run is located in a different location and must be called explictly using `/run/challenge/bin/nc`. This is important
