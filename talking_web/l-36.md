## Problem

Make an HTTP request to `127.0.0.1` on port `80` to get the flag. Make any HTTP request, and the server will ask you to set a cookie. Make another request with that cookie to get the flag. You must make this request using python

## Steps

### Notes

I found I was able to get the flag by just sending a simple get requests to localhost on port 80 without specifiying anything else in to the requests function.

```python
import requests


def main():
    print(requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:80/").text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

### solution.sh

```python
import requests


def main():
    print(requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:80/").text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
