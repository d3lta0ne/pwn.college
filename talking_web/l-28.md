# Problem

Make an HTTP request to 127.0.0.1 on port 80 to get the flag.
The HTTP request must specify a content type HTTP header of 'application/json'
Must send an HTTP POST with the body as a JSON object that has:
a pair with name of `a` and a value of 8aaf93165bcc28b12142a05a332d3bf7
a pair with name of `b` and a value of a object that has:
a pair with name of `c` and a value of cef1c1d3
a pair with name of `d` and a value that is a list with the following elements:
fca90452
b19320f6 586fb9e4&b194eb55#55ef50da
You must make this request using the curl command

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:80 -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"a":"8aaf93165bcc28b12142a05a332d3bf7", "b": {"c": "cef1c1d3","d": [ "fca90452", "b19320f6 586fb9e4&b194eb55#55ef50da"]}}'
```
