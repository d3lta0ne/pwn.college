# Problem
Make an HTTP request to 127.0.0.1 on port 80 to get the flag.
The HTTP request must specify a content type HTTP header of 'application/json'
Must send an HTTP POST with the body as a JSON object that has a pair with name of `a` and a value of b10550342661d0d71da0a9307195fc15
You must make this request using the nc command

# Process
```bash
# HTTP POST Request w/ netcat
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=80
PATH='/'
DATA='{a:583380eef26d372f7e6bf15a7f1ef725}'
CONTENT_LENGTH=${#DATA}

# Use a here-document to send the POST request with nc
/run/challenge/bin/nc $HOST $PORT <<EOF
POST $PATH HTTP/1.0
Host: $HOST
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: $CONTENT_LENGTH

$DATA
EOF

echo $REQUEST | nc $HOST $PORT
```
