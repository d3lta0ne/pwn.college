# Problem

[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific parent process : ipython
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdin : rev
[INFO] - the challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : jmvhumwc
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag

# Process

After creating `~/script.py` using the provided code, I start the ipython program by running `/usr/bin/ipython` then I execute my script using `%run ~/script.py`. After running the script and entering the password in backwards (i.e. `cwmuhvmj`), you will have to send a new-line `[ENTER]` and an end of input control character `[CTRL-D]`.


## Notes

Ensure to run `/usr/bin/ipython` instead of `ipython` to bypass the following error:

```plaintext
  File "/challenge/chio.py", line 7, in <module>
    import asteval
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'asteval'
```
