# Problem
WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
 - the challenge checks for a specific parent process : bash
 - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdout : grep

# Process
Remember to run /usr/bin/bash to make sure that the environment is running correctly.

## Code
```bash
/usr/bin/bash && /challenge/run | /bin/grep .
```
## Notes
We need to make sure that we run grep with a command-line argument so that it does not return an error, but it is important to not that we will receive the flag regardless of what we search for using grep.
