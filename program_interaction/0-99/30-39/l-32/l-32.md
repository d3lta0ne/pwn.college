# Problem
WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
- the challenge checks for a specific parent process : binary
- the challenge will check that env[KEY] holds value VALUE (listed to the right as KEY:VALUE) : mrsqev:oaxcmkzbmf

# Process
We write and then compile our script program using the following command `gcc ~/l-32.c -o ~/l-32`.

Attempting to solve this problem by setting the enviornmental variable `mrsqev` to `oaxcmkzbmf` using setenv() and the environ variable.

Using the information we accquired from the references we found, we set the variable using setenv() the then pass the environ variable to execve().

## References
From the exec manpage. `man exec | grep environment`
> All other exec() functions (which do not include 'e' in the suffix) take the environment for the new process image from the external variable environ in the calling process.


From the environ manpage. `man environ | grep setenv`
> A C program can manipulate its environment using the functions getenv(3), putenv(3), setenv(3), and unsetenv(3).

setenv() File Prototype and Declaration
```c
    int setenv(const char *name, const char *value, int overwrite);
```
