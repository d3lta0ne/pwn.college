# Problem
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific parent process : shellscript
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdin : rev
[INFO] - the challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : lvdfdnpl
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag

# Process
After running the script and entering the password in backwards (i.e. `lpndfdvl`), you will have to send a new-line `[ENTER]` and an end of input control character `[CTRL-D]`.

## Code
```bash
#!/bin/bash
/bin/rev | /challenge/run
```
