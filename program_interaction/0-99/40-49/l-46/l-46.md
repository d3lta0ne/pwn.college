# Problem
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific parent process : shellscript
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdin : cat
[INFO] - the challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : ikreafwq
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag

# Process
We have to make sure to run `/bin/bash` in it's interactive-mode and thus can not submit our solution through a shell script. I created a file `password` that I created with the password `aljgoaqw` inside.

## Code
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo -ne "ikreafwq" > ~/password
/bin/cat ~/password - | /challenge/run 
```

## Notes
You will have to send an `[ENTER]` to get the flag.
