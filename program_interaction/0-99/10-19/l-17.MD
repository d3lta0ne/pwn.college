Start by invoking ipython

```python
from pwn import *

p = process(['/challenge/embryoio_level17', 'gdyotqlojf'])
p.interactive()
```

## Notes

It is important to run the p, process as a set of arrays as this ensures that the process is invoked from python. Else the parent process becomes invoked by /usr/bin/dash when passing commands.
