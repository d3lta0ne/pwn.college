# Problem
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific parent process : bash
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdin : rev
[INFO] - the challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : uylrjwuj
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag


# Process
We have to make sure to run `/bin/bash` in it's interactive-mode and thus can not submit our solution through a shell script. After hardcoding the password in backwards `juwjrlyu`, I send a CTRL-D to end accpeting input.

## Code
```bash
/bin/rev | /challenge/run 
```

## Notes
You might have to send an EOF flag to stop accepting input or the terminal will hand while waiting for rev input. It is also important to pass the hard-coded password in backwards.
