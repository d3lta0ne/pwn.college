# Problem
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific parent process : bash
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdin : cat
[INFO] - the challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : aljgoaqw
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag

# Process
We have to make sure to run `/bin/bash` in it's interactive-mode and thus can not submit our solution through a shell script. I created a file `password` that I created with the password `aljgoaqw` inside.

## Code
```bash
/bin/cat password - | /challenge/run 
```

## Notes
You can pass this level by only running `/bin/cat - | /challenge/run` and manually passing the password over stdin.
