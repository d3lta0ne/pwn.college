# Problem

[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific parent process : ipython
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdin : cat
[INFO] - the challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : pslelrml
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag


# Process

After creating `~/script.py` using the provided code, I start the ipython program by running `/usr/bin/ipython` then I execute my script using `%run ~/script.py`.

## Notes

You will need to send an [ENTER] to stop the program from waiting for user input and print the flag.

Ensure to run `/usr/bin/ipython` instead of `ipython` to bypass the following error:

```plaintext
  File "/challenge/chio.py", line 7, in <module>
    import asteval
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'asteval'
```
