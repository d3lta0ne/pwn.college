# Problem
WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
 - the challenge checks for a specific parent process : bash
 - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdout : cat

# Process
We have to make sure to run /bin/bash in it's interactive-mode and thus can not submit our solution through a shell script.

## Code
```bash
/challenge/run | /bin/cat
```

## Notes
It is important to not that we must explicitly pass /bin/cat to the /challenge/run function as the symbolic link to cat will not work.
