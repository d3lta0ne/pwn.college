# Problem
WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
- the challenge checks for a specific parent process : binary
- the challenge will check that the environment is empty (except LC_CTYPE, which is impossible to get rid of in some cases)

# Process
The two ways that I came to solving this challenge involved creating an environ variable and setting it to NULL when passing it into execve or just by passing NULL into `execve()`.

## Notes
The challenge script is no longer "/challenge/embryoio_level*" but just "/challenge/run". This is important to be noted in the argument passed into `arg[]`.
