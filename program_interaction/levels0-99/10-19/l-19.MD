# Process
Before invoking the ipython we must create the specifed file that is requested in the project. We do this by using the following command: `echo "yltuzpik" > /tmp/gzxehm`. This can also optionally be done within ipython but I prefer doing it earlier since I always run the challenge first to see if it is still even an ipython challenge. We then invoke `ipython` in the shell.

## Program
```python
import subprocess

# Path to the challenge
executable_path = '/challenge/embryoio_level19'

# Arguments to pass to the executable
args = []

# Environmental Variables to pass to subprocess
sub_env = {}

# Run the executable with the specific file as input
with open('/tmp/gzxehm', 'w+') as input_file:
    # Write the hardcoded password to the file
    # Use this line only if you did not create the file with text using bash. 
    input_file.write('yltuzpik\n')

    # Move the file pointer to the beginning of the file
    input_file.seek(0)

    result = subprocess.run([executable_path] + args, capture_output=True, text=True, env=sub_env, stdin=input_file)

# Print the output and error messages
print("Output:", result.stdout)
# print("Error:", result.stderr)
# print("Return Code:", result.returncode)
```
## Notes
You can only use stdin or input when nvoking the run method. I use the stdin parameter as I am passing a file in as input and redirecting stdin. Addtionally I have to add my hardcoded password into the tmp file as I can't pass values into both stdin and input. If the file was created and password was passed using bash take care to open /tmp/gzxehm using 'r' instead of 'w+' as to not overwrite the existing data in the file.
