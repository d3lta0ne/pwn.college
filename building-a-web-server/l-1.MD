# Problem
===== Welcome to Building a Web Server! =====
In this series of challenges, you will be writing assembly to interact with your environment, and ultimately build a web server
In this challenge you will exit a program.

Usage: `/challenge/run <path_to_web_server>`

$ cat server.s
.intel_syntax noprefix
.globl _start

.section .text

_start:
    mov rdi, 0
    mov rax, 60     # SYS_exit
    syscall

.section .data

$ as -o server.o server.s && ld -o server server.o

$ strace ./server
execve("./server", ["./server"], 0x7ffccb8c6480 /* 17 vars */) = 0
exit(0)                                 = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++

$ /challenge/run ./server
