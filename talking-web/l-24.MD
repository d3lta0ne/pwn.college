# Problem
After running the challenge program (`/challenge/run`), we are presented with the following task objectives:

Make an HTTP request to 127.0.0.1 on port 80 to get the flag.
The HTTP request must specify HTTP POST parameters:
`a` as value 1f42fc2145c6e7351a2b71f8b63d5984
`b` as value 0d34ee4c 27b09b57&9c7bd266#ae6a7d1a
You must make this request using python

# Process
```bash
python3 -c "import requests; print(requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:80/', data={'a':'1f42fc2145c6e7351a2b71f8b63d5984', 'b':'0d34ee4c 27b09b57&9c7bd266#ae6a7d1a'}).text)"
```

## Notes
It is important to note that there is not need to url encode the values of the parameters as with python I don't have to worry about special characters not being passed through. In fact, attempting to URL Encode the parameters results in the wrong data being sent to the http server.
